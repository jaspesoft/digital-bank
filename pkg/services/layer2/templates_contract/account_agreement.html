            <h4>Section VIII.08 Withholding Tax</h4>
            <p>If Layer2 determines that it is required to withhold amounts in respect of Tax owing by the Customer, such determination to be made in Layer2’s sole discretion, Layer2 may deduct such required withholding amounts (the “Withholding Amount”) from amounts otherwise owed to Customer and pay the Withholding Amount to the appropriate Governmental Authority. If Customer is exempt from paying Tax on the particular transaction, or is otherwise eligible to have a reduced withholding rate in respect of the particular transaction, the Customer may provide to Layer2 an original certificate, issued by the appropriate Governmental Authority, that satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to the Tax-exempt status of the Customer or the transaction, or the reduced rate of applicable to the Withholding Amount, in which case Layer2, if satisfied, in its sole discretion, will reduce the Withholding Amount in accordance with the certificate or Layer2’s understanding of the applicable facts. Customer must provide accurate information regarding its Tax affairs as Layer2 reasonably requests and must promptly notify Layer2 if any information in Layer2’s possession is inaccurate or incomplete. Layer2 may send documents to the Customer and Governmental Authorities for transactions processed using the Services. Specifically, Applicable Law may require Layer2 to file periodic informational returns with Governmental Authorities related to the Customer’s use of the Services. Layer2 may send Tax-related information electronically to Customer.</p>

In order to amend a Direction or Entry, the Customer may be required to submit a new Direction to Layer2 through the Platform or in a different format than the original Direction.

            <li>(iii) the Customer hereby agrees that Layer2 shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether to support such Forked Network and that the Customer shall have no right or claim against Layer2 related to value represented by any change in the value of any Digital Asset (whether on a Forked Network or otherwise), including with respect to any period of time during which Layer2 exercises its rights described herein with respect to Forks and Forked Networks,</li>
            <li>(iv) Layer2 will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely select, in its sole discretion, at least one (1) of the Forked Networks to support and will identify such selection in a written notice posted on the Platform,</li>
            <li>(v) With respect to a Forked Network that Layer2 chooses not to support, it may, in its sole discretion, elect to:

Accordingly, Layer2 disclaims all liability relating to Forked Network and any change in the value of any Digital Assets (whether on a Forked Network or otherwise), and makes no guarantees regarding the security, functionality, or availability of such protocols or Digital Asset networks.

            <li>If Layer2 supports, obtains or delivers Airdropped Digital Assets, such actions will not create any relationship between the Sender and Layer2, grant any interest or rights to the Sender (including, without limitation, any third party beneficiary rights), or subject Layer2 to any obligations as it relates to the Sender.</li>

            <li>(g) legislative and regulatory changes or actions under Applicable Laws may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets;</li>
            <li>(h) transactions in Digital Assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to negligent, fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;</li>
            <li>(i) some Digital Asset transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the transaction was initiated;</li>
            <li>(j) the value of Digital Assets may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Currency or Digital Assets for Digital Assets, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Asset should the market for that Digital Asset disappear;</li>
            <li>(k) there is no assurance that a Person who accepts a Digital Asset as payment today will continue to do so in the future;</li>
            <li>(l) due to the volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Assets relative to Currency trading and owning Digital Assets may result in a significant loss over a short period of time; and</li>
            <li>(m) Digital Asset values can fluctuate substantially which may result in a total loss of the value of Digital Assets.</li>
