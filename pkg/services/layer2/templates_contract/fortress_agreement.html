<h1>FORTRESS TRUST ACCOUNT AGREEMENT</h1>

<article>
    <section>
        <p>
            IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the
            government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires financial
            institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each individual or entity that opens
            an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of
            birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s
            license or other identifying documents.
        </p>
    </section>
    <p>The undersigned account holder (“Account Holder”) hereby requests and directs that Fortress Trust LLC
        (“Fortress”), a Nevada financial institution (dba Fortress TC), establish one or more Fortress Trust Account(s)
        (collectively, the “Account”) for and in the name of Account Holder, and to hold as custodian all assets
        contributed to, or collected with respect to such Account, upon the following terms and conditions (the
        “Agreement:”):</p>

    <!--    page 1-->
    <section>
        <h3>1. SELF-DIRECTED ACCOUNT:</h3>
        <p>1.1 Account Holder hereby appoints Fortress to serve as custodian of and to hold or process as directed all
            assets contributed by Account Holder (“Custodial Property”) that are delivered to Fortress by Account Holder
            or your Agent(s) (as defined below) to the Account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Account
            Holder is creating one or more self-directed Accounts with situs in the State of Nevada, in each case
            subject to the terms of this Agreement. Fortress will act solely as custodian of the Custodial Property and
            will not exercise any investment or other discretion regarding your Account or Custodial Property. Fortress
            undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein, all of which are ministerial in
            nature.</p>

        <p>1.2 Account Holder acknowledges and agrees that: (i) the value of your Custodial Property will be solely
            dependent upon the performance of any asset(s) chosen by you and/or your Agents; (ii) Fortress shall have no
            duty or obligation to review or perform due diligence on any investments or other Custodial Property
            contributed to your Account, (iii) Fortress does not provide any valuation or appraisals of Custodial
            Property, and (iv) Fortress role is that of a passive, pass-through capacity in providing such information
            (if any) on your Account statements and that such valuation estimates or price quotations are neither
            verified, substantiated nor to be relied upon in any way, for any purpose, including, without limitation,
            tax reporting purposes. As a self-directed account, Fortress shall not conduct any due diligence on
            Custodial Property, including ascertaining the cost basis or assets or otherwise review the suitability of
            any contributed Custodial Property, except as required by applicable regulations.</p>

        <p>1.3 You agree to engage an independent advisor for any valuation opinion(s) or other professional advice with
            respect to any Custodial Property.</p>

        <p>1.4 Account Holder may designate and appoint one or more third-parties as agents on your Account (“Agents”)
            by providing access to your Accounts directly through online dashboard access provided by Fortress or
            indirectly through third-party integrators used to access your Account. By providing an Agent access to your
            account, Agents shall have full access to your Account(s) and the authority to instruct Fortress to execute
            transactions in your Account, including transferring and disbursing funds. Account Holder bears complete and
            absolute responsibility for all buy, sell, transfer, and disbursement instructions for this Account and will
            immediately notify Fortress of any unauthorized transactions. Any actions undertaken by any of your Agents
            are deemed to be those of the Account Holder directly, and you agree to maintain the security of your login
            credentials and passwords, as well as Agent access lists and associated permissions, so only your authorized
            persons have access to your Account. Fortress shall also be entitled to rely and act upon any instructions,
            notices, confirmations or orders received from your Agent(s), including third-party integrated platforms
            used to access the Account, as if such communication was received directly from the Account Holder without
            any required further review or approval. Account Holder is solely responsible for monitoring and supervising
            the actions of your Agents with respect to the Account and Custodial Property.</p>

        <p>1.5 Account Holder will not direct or permit its Agents to direct the purchase, sale or transfer of any
            Custodial Property which is not permissible under the laws of Account Holder’s place of residence or illegal
            under US federal, state or local law. Account Holder is solely responsible for compliance with any such
            restrictions.</p>

        <p>1.6 Account Holder hereby warrants that neither you nor your Agents will enter into a transaction or series
            of transactions, or cause a transaction to be entered into, which is prohibited under Section 4975 of the
            Internal Revenue Code. Pursuant to the directions of the Account Holder or Agent(s), Fortress shall process
            the investment and reinvestment of Custodial Property as directed by Account Holder or its Agents only so
            long as, in the sole judgment of Fortress, such requested investments will not impose an unreasonable
            administrative burden on Fortress (which such determination by Fortress shall not to be construed in any
            respect as a judgment concerning the prudence or advisability of such investment) or potentially violate
            applicable law. Fortress may rely upon any notice, instruction, request or other instrument believed by it
            to have been delivered from the Account Holder or its Agents, not only as to its due execution, validity and
            effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any information contained therein.</p>
        <p> 1.7 Account Holder acknowledges that any request to waive or change any policies or procedures for asset
            disbursements is done so at Account Holders risk. Fortress may decline to accept verbal asset transfer or
            trade instructions in its sole discretion and require written instructions, or instructions triggered from
            Account Holder or its Agents using tools while logged into your Account.</p>
        <p> 1.8 Account Holder understands that if your account is dormant for ninety days or more, Fortress may, at its
            discretion and upon notice, terminate and close your Account. In the event that Fortress is unable to
            contact you or your Agent, Account balance may be escheated in accordance with applicable law. If your
            Account balance is escheated, you agree that Fortress is relieved of all responsibility for the balance
            escheated.</p>

        <h3>2. CUSTODIAL PROPERTY & SERVICES:</h3>

        <p>2.1 Fortress shall have the right to accept or decline contributions of Custodial Property at its sole
            discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Fortress does not accept physical assets such
            as gold, stock certificates, bonds etc. into custody. Fortress also accepts a limited number of
            cryptocurrencies and reserves the right to restrict cryptocurrencies at any time upon the advice of counsel.
            For more information on acceptable assets, please contact support@fortresstrust.us. Fortress is authorized
            to collect into custody all property delivered to Fortress at the time of execution of this Agreement, as
            well as all property which is hereafter purchased for your Account or which may hereafter to be delivered to
            Fortress for your Account pursuant to this Agreement, together with the income, including but not limited to
            interest, dividends, proceeds of sale and all other monies due and collectable attributable to the
            investment of the Custodial Property.</p>

        <p>2.2 Fortress shall be responsible for safekeeping only Custodial Property which is delivered and accepted
            into its possession and control. Fortress may for convenience take and hold title to Custodial Property or
            any part thereof in its own name (for the benefit of its customers) or in the name of its nominee with
            Account Holder ownership of Custodial Property segregated on its books and records.</p>

        <p>2.3 Fortress shall keep accurate records of segregation of customer accounts to show all receipts,
            disbursements, and other transactions involving the Account. All such records shall be held indefinitely by
            Fortress. Fortress shall collect and hold all funds when Custodial Property may mature, be redeemed or sold.
            Fortress shall hold the proceeds of such transaction(s) until receipt of written or electronic (via our
            systems) disbursement instructions from Account Holder.</p>

        <p>2.4 Fortress shall process any purchase, sale, exchange, investment, disbursement or reinvestment of
            Custodial Property under this Agreement that Account Holder or its Agents may at any time direct, provided
            that sufficient unencumbered, cleared assets are available for such transaction.</p>

        <p>2.5 Funds received in foreign currencies will be automatically converted to US Dollars at exchange rates set
            by Fortress. For foreign currency accounts, please contact support@fortresstrust.us.</p>

        <p>2.6 Fortress is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders issued or entered by any court with
            respect to the Custodial Property held hereunder, without determination by Fortress of such court’s
            jurisdiction in the matter. If any portion of the Custodial Property held hereunder is at any time attached,
            garnished or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
            delivery of any such property shall be stayed or enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment
            or decree shall be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof, then and in any
            such event, Fortress is authorized, in its sole discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order,
            writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it without the
            need for appeal or other action, and if Fortress complies with any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it
            shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person or entity by reason of such
            compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may be subsequently reversed, modified,
            annulled, set aside or vacated.</p>

        <p>2.7 The Account is not a brokerage or trading account and should not be used for such purpose. Fortress does
            not warrant or guarantee that any buy or sell instructions to Fortress by Account Holder will be executed at
            the best posted price, timely executed or executed at all. Account Holder acknowledges and agrees that (i)
            Fortress does not have access to every market or exchange which a particular product or financial instrument
            may be purchased or sold and Fortress makes no representation regarding the best price, execution of any
            instructions, timely execution or its continued availability of such services, (ii) other orders may be
            executed ahead of Account Holder’s order and exhaust available volume at a posted price, (iii) exchanges,
            market makers or other types of sellers or purchasers may fail to honor posted or otherwise agreed-upon
            prices, (iv) exchanges may re-route customer orders out of automated execution systems for manual handling
            (in which case, execution may be substantially delayed), (iv) system delays by exchanges or third-parties
            executing instructions may prevent Account Holders order from being executed, may cause a delay in execution
            or not to be executed at the best posted price or at all, and, (v) Fortress may not promptly or in a timely
            manner execute Account Holder’s order(s) due to internal delays, and Fortress makes no representation that
            its custody services are in any way suitable for active trading or any activity requiring prompt or exact
            execution. Fortress may execute such purchase instructions as a riskless principal. Transactions may be
            subject to additional fees and charges by both Fortress and any third-party service providers or
            exchanges.</p>

            legal fees, accounting fees, tax preparation fees, notary fees, exchange fees, brokerage fees, bank fees,
            blockchain settlement fees, etc.) without prior approval.</p>

            fees and expenses, including charging any linked credit or debit card, pulling funds from any linked bank
            account, or liquidating any of the Custodial Property without prior notice or liability. Fortress reserves
            the right to liquidate Custodial Property to cover any and all outstanding amounts due by you to Fortress at
            its sole discretion and without liability for any losses.</p>

        <p>Account Holder agrees to be liable to Fortress for any loss, cost or expense that we incur as a result of any
            dispute, attachment, garnishment, levy or subpoena of records involving your account, including reasonable
            attorneys' fees whether incurred at trial, on any appeal therefrom or otherwise, to the fullest extent

        <p>Account Holder hereby agrees to receive electronic statements only. Account statements, including transaction
            history, asset balances with transaction history are available on your Account or websites or applications
            of its selected third-party integrators at your discretion to view current or historic statements, as well
            as transaction history, assets and cash balances.</p>

        <p>Account Holder may elect to withdraw such consent by contacting your Fortress account representative.

            to withhold the disbursement of Custodial Property to hold such property in suspense to mitigate risks of

            institute with prior notice velocity or transaction limits on transaction activity for your Account(s) to

        <h3>6. TERM AND TERMINATION, MODIFICATION:</h3>

        <p>6.1 This Agreement is effective as of the date set forth below and shall continue in force until terminated
            by either party at any time upon 30 days written notice to the other party (with email being an agreed upon
            method of such notice). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Fortress may immediately terminate this agreement
            without prior notice or liability in the event that:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fortress reasonably believes that Account Holder may be engaged in activity that may violate applicable
                law,
            </li>
            <li>Termination is deemed appropriate by Fortress to comply with its legal or regulatory obligations;</li>
            <li>Upon death of the Account Holder, provided, however, Fortress shall continue to hold Custodial Property
                until such time Fortress receives instructions from Account Holder’s executor, trustee or administrator
                pursuant to the probate process, as applicable, and has received advice of its legal counsel to transfer
                such assets (which costs shall be borne by the Account Holder);
            </li>
            <li>Filing of a petition in bankruptcy by the Account Holders or by a creditor of the Account Holders; or
            </li>
            <li>The legal incompetency of Account Holder, unless there is in existence a valid durable power of attorney
                or trust agreement authorizing another to succeed or act for Account Holder with respect to this
                agreement.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>6.2 This Agreement may be amended or modified only by Fortress, or with the written agreement from Fortress.
            Such amendments or modifications shall be effective on the 30th day after the Account Holder receives notice
            of such revision electronically via the email address shown on the records of Fortress.</p>

        <p>6.3 Upon termination, Fortress shall deliver the Custodial Property to Account Holder as soon as practicable
            or, at Account Holder or it’s Agents request to a successor custodian. Account Holder acknowledges that
            Custodial Property held in Fortress’s name or nominee may require additional time to process.</p>

        <p>6.4 If this Agreement terminates due to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, termination or dissolution of
            Account Holder, Fortress shall deliver the Custodial Property to the Court appointed representative for
            Account Holder. If no representative has been appointed by the Court, Fortress may deliver the Custodial
            Property to the person it deems to be an agent of the Account Holder and such delivery will release Fortress
            from any further responsibility for said Custodial Property.</p>

        <h3>9. INDEMNIFICATION:</h3>

        <p>9.1 Account Holder agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Fortress and its shareholders, directors,
            officers, employees and agents (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, costs,
            expenses, fees, claims, damages, liabilities and causes of actions (including, but not limited to,
            reasonable attorney fees and disbursements) of third parties resulting or arising from:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>(a) Account Holder, or its Agent’s, failure to abide by or perform any obligation imposed upon Account
                Holder under this agreement,
            </li>
            <li>(b) the willful misconduct, fraud, criminal activity, intentional tort or negligence of Account Holder
                or any of its representatives involving use of the Account and the services provided by Fortress;
            </li>
            <li>(c) the actions, omissions or commissions of Account Holder, its employees, consultants and/or agents
                relating to the services provided by Fortress; and
            </li>
            <li>(d) any payment request, wire transfer, transmission or instruction, whether or not authorized, acted
                upon by Fortress in good faith.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Account Holder shall be provided with prompt notice of any claims and given full authority and assistance (at
            Account Holder’s expense) for the defense of any such claims; provided that Fortress may participate in such
            defense and settlement with counsel of Fortress’ own choosing at Fortress’ own expense; provided, further,
            however, Account Holder shall have no authority to settle any claim against any Indemnified Party without
            the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).</p>

        <p>9.2 Account Holder agrees to bear sole responsibility for the prosecution or defense, including the
            employment of legal counsel, of any and all legal actions or suits involving the Account, which may arise or
            become necessary for the protection of the investments in that Account, including any actions lodged against
            Fortress. Account Holder also agrees to bear sole responsibility for enforcing any judgments rendered in
            favor of the Account, including judgments rendered in the name of Fortress as Fortress of the Account.
            Account Holder agrees to be responsible for any and all collection actions, including contracting with a
            collection agency or institutional legal action, and bringing any other suits or actions which may become
            necessary to protect the rights of the Account. Account Holder understands that any legal filings made on
            behalf of this Investment are to be made on behalf of beneficial owners for whom Fortress acts as custodian.
            Account Holder agrees not to institute legal action on behalf of the Account without Fortress’s written
            consent to litigate and that Account Holder shall prosecute any legal action. Account Holder agrees that any
            such legal action will be carried out in a manner that does not cause Fortress to incur any costs or legal
            exposure.</p>

            including administrative proceedings, garnishment, tax levies, restraining orders or another action is
            brought against you or your account, you will be liable to us for any loss, cost or expense (including

            confirmation of receipt, delivery or reading, and such form of electronic communication is sufficient for
            all matters regarding the relationship between the parties. If any such electronically-sent communication
            fails to be received for any reason, including but not limited to such communications being diverted to the
            recipients’ spam filters by the recipients email service provider, or due to a recipients’ change of
            address, or due to technology issues by the recipients’ service provider, the parties agree that the burden
            of such failure to receive is on the recipient and not the sender, and that the sender is under no
            obligation to resend communications via any other means, including but not limited to postal service or
            overnight courier, and that such communications shall for all purposes, including legal and regulatory, be
            deemed to have been delivered and received. No physical, paper documents will be sent to Account Holder, and
            if Account Holder desire physical documents then it agrees to be satisfied by directly and personally
            printing, at Account Holder’s own expense, either the electronically-sent communication(s) or the
            electronically available communications by logging onto Account Holder’s Account online and then maintaining
            such physical records in any manner or form that Account Holder desire. Account Holder agrees that we may
            call or send text messages to you at the telephone numbers that you provide to us, including a cell phone
            number, which may result in charges to you, for informational purposes regarding your Account with us. These
